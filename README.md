## Todo:

Task 1:

- write a function which fits a logistic regression model
  
  - takes arguments of data, and names of variables to fit
  
  - returns model

- write function to calculate probability of survival for a given set of inputs using given model
  
  - takes arguments of variables for one person
  
  - returns probability of survival



Task 2:

- write function to create tibble of all probabilities of survival (jackson)
  
  - takes arguments of tibble of all data
  
  - uses existing functions to make model and calculate probabilities
  
  - returns a tibble with probabilities added

- write function to output graph(s) of survival probability
  
  - takes arguments of tibble of all data
  
  - uses existing functions
  
  - makes plots



Task 3:
